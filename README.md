- Authentication: Secure login and token generation using JWT.
- OTP Generation: Generate and validate one-time passwords.
- CORS Configuration: Allow cross-origin requests from specified domains.
- OAuth Integration: Support for third-party authentication providers.


## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- JPA/Hibernate
- JWT for authentication
